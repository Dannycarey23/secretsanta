# Secret Santa

This app is a solo project based on the secret santa game that we have all been subjected to at somepoint. 

## MVP
* A welcome page explaining how secret santa works, a navigation bar containing log in and register buttons
* User can register to access a form to create their own profile. 
* User profile should contain:
    * User's Name.
    * User's Age.
    * User's Email Address.
    * A list of the user's 'likes'.
    * A list of the user's 'dislikes'.
    * A link to their giftee's profile (once assigned).
    * A countdown to the day their present should be gifted.
* Admins will have access to everything standard user's have, as well as access to create a 'Pool' of players that will be randomly assigned to each other.
